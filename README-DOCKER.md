## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Docker credential helper error
If you see: `docker-credential-osxkeychain: executable file not found`

**Quick fix:**
```bash
./fix-docker-creds.sh
```

This will automatically configure Docker to not use the credential helper (which isn't needed for Colima).

### Colima won't start
```bash
# Check system requirements
colima status

# Restart Colima
colima stop
colima start
```

### Docker commands not found
After installing Colima, make sure Docker is in your PATH:
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Port conflicts
If port 8000 is already in use, change it in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8001:8000"  # Use 8001 instead
```

### Build warnings
The warnings about `version` in docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile casing are harmless and have been fixed in the latest versions. If you see them, update to the latest files.
